# Bike Sharing Radar Southtyrol

This is a simple static web application I developed in collaboration with Jonas Gatterer for an University project.


#### Idea

It's supposed to help people to find the nearest bike sharing station to their position or a position they search for. Just try it out!


#### Demo

A demo version of the project is hosted under the following URL:
